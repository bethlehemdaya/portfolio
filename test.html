        <li><a href="I am a motivated and detail-oriented professional with a background in Materials Engineering and a growing specialization in software development and quality assurance. Currently enhancing my technical skill set through hands-on training in tools such as Selenium, TestNG, Maven, Git, Jenkins, and Postman, I am passionate about building robust, efficient, and user-centered software systems. My engineering foundation strengthens my analytical thinking and problem-solving approach, while my exposure to QA and development practices enables me to bridge the gap between product design, functionality, and performance. I am eager to contribute to innovative software projects and thrive in collaborative, agile environments that value continuous learning and improvement.">About Me</a></li>
        
        <li><a href="I bring a strong foundation in quality assurance testing, with hands-on experience using tools such as Selenium, TestNG, Maven, Git, Jenkins, and Postman for both manual and automated testing processes. My academic and research background in materials engineering has equipped me with expertise in laboratory techniques including pH measurement, reverse osmosis systems, and materials characterization methods like SEM and XRD. I possess excellent analytical and problem-solving skills, with the ability to document findings clearly and precisely. In addition, my studies in human anatomy and physiology, coupled with psychology coursework, have strengthened my understanding of scientific terminology, human behavior, and laboratory safety protocols. I am highly organized, detail-oriented, and proficient in Microsoft Office and technical writing. I value teamwork, effective communication, and adaptability—skills that enable me to thrive in both collaborative and independent work environments.">Skills</a></li>
